# EPA_Vehicle_Emissions_Visualizations_with_Tableau

Project Description:
This project is to model and predict MPG (miles per gallon) using know vehicle specifications from a current EPA data set that ranged from 1984 to 2023 model years of US vehicles. After significant filtering and cleaning the data was visualized through Tableau and placed into a polynomial regression model. Then this model is used to predict expected MPG from vehicle specifications input through an interactive website.

Some take-aways from the visualizations:

- 50% of vehicles fall between 17 and 23 MPG.
- Smaller vehicle types have a broader range of MPG compared to larger vehicle types, making them less predictable.
- Front-Wheel Drives have a greater MPG compared to Rear and Four-Wheel Drive.
- Generally, fewer cylinders the greater the MPG. Similar to L(displacement), less displacement has greater MPG.
- Year and MPG does not have a significant trend apart from a broader range in MPG from 2013-2023.
