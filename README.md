# EPA_Vehicle_Emissions_Visualizations_with_Tableau

Project Description:
This project is to model and predict MPG (miles per gallon) using know vehicle specifications from a current EPA data set that ranged from 1984 to 2023 model years of US vehicles. After significant filtering and cleaning the data was visualized through Tableau and placed into a polynomial regression model. Then this model is used to predict expected MPG from vehicle specifications input through an interactive website.
